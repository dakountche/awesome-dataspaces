## Protocols

- [Dataspace Protocol](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/dataspace-protocol): The Dataspace Protocol is a set of specifications designed to facilitate interoperable data sharing between entities governed by usage control and based on Web technologies.

- [Decentralized Claims Protocol](https://eclipse-dataspace-dcp.github.io/decentralized-claims-protocol/v1.0.1/): Defines a set of protocols for asserting participant identities, issuing verifiable credentials, and presenting verifiable credentials using a decentralized architecture for verification and trust.


## Connectors

- [Eclipse Dataspace Connector](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector?tab=readme-ov-file): The EDC is a set of components that enable developers to create dataspaces using the following building blocks: Identity service, Catalogue service, Control plane services, Data plane and monitoring services. 

- [FIWARE Data Space Connector](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-space-connector): The FDSC is a set of components that implements DSBA Technical Convergence recommendations. The FDSC is  deployed by every organization participating in a data space. 
 
- [FIWARE TRUE Connector](https://github.com/Engineering-Research-and-Development/fiware-true-connector): The FTC is a connector for the IDS (International Data Space) ecosystem. It is has three components: the Execution Core Container, the FIWARE Data Application and the Usage-Control Data application. This project is not maintained.  


## Reference Implementations

- [Eclipse Tractus-X](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx): Tractus-X is an open-source project that aims to facilitate the deployment of Data Spaces based on EDC in various industries, including automotive, manufacturing, chemical, and energy sectors. Tractus-X is used in [Catena-X](https://catena-x.net/) and several other dataspaces.

- [SIMPL](https://code.europa.eu/simpl/simpl-open/documentation/user-manual): SIMPL is an open source, smart and secure middleware platform that supports data access and interoperability among European data spaces.  SIMPL uses the Eclipse Connector in the agents of a SIMPL-based Dataspace. These agents are: Consumer, Data Provider, Governance Authority and Infrastructure Provider.
